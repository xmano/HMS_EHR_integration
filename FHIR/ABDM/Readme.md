Information related to FHIR implementation

Here are some pointers for ABDM FHIR Integration

Please find below the essential resources for implementing the FHIR:

HAPI Dependency for Validation: Ensure you include the required HAPI dependency in your project to facilitate FHIR bundle validation. • hapi-fhir-validation: This module performs validation of FHIR resources against standard and custom FHIR profiles. (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ca.uhn.hapi.fhir/hapi-fhir-validation) • hapi-fhir-validation-resources-r4: This library includes base resources required for validating specific FHIR R4 ensuring proper compliance with FHIR. (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ca.uhn.hapi.fhir/hapi-fhir-validation-resources-r4)

NPM Package for NHCX: Package contains all the structure definitions, codesystems, and value sets for ABDM & NHCX required for validation: NPM Package (https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/downloads.html)
